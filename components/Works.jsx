        I am a creative developer who relishes the challenge of turning ideas in
        unforgettable digital experiences. I have worked as an independent
        graphic designer for over 3 years and this love for beautiful and slick
        visuals resonates in my web applications. I specialize in front-end
        development but I like to get my hands dirty with backends too. My
        expertise also spans logo and flyer design, video ad development, and
        illustrations.
